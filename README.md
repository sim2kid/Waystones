A simple waystone plugin for paper-mc servers

## How To Use Blerb
By placing a lodestone (and using /waystone create <name> to create it) you  can now make your own teleportation points around the map!
There's no limit to how many you can make, but each time you place a new one, there's a period of time it needs to charge.

When you have a charged and active Waystone, you need to be near it to teleport somewhere.
For now, you need to run /waystone tp <Waystone Name> or /waystone teleport <Creator> <Waystone> to teleport.
All known and available waystones will Tab-Complete for you.
(I'm working on refining those commands in the future.)

If you want to be able to use your friend's waystone, you need to visit them first. 
Once a waystone is discovered, you can teleport back to it.
