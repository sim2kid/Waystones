# In blocks, the max distance you can be to use a waystone.
# When outside this distance, you can't use any waystone commands
# This value must be at least 1
use-distance: 6

# You'll want to keep this number above 10ish but below 32ish
near-distance: 20

# The distance to search from the player for lodestones
# The bigger this is, the slower the game will run.
# Try to keep this under 10.

# Waystone Charge-Up time On Build
# When you place a Waystone, it takes this long before anyone can use it

# Can be bypassed with waystone.charge.ignore
# Can also be set in perms with waystone.charge.# (Takes lowest number)
# --> Permission ignored when using diminishing returns.

# Charging Math

# Whether to use math to increase charge time with each waystone owned.
# When false, charge-time stays constant

# This is the formula we will use to calculate the charge time:

#  [Actual Charge Time] = [Base] + [Figure]
#
# [Base] = charge-time (listed above)
# [Figure] = charge-figure (down below)
# [Exponent] = Number of Waystones Created (Known in Game)
# [ExponentLeft] = exponent-left

# Positive numbers only (And zero)
exponent-left: 4.7
# Set this to true if figure field and exponent fields should be flipped in the formula
